# Scrimish

A turn-based player vs. AI game based on the real-life card game "Scrimish" (Can be found at http://www.scrimish.com/).
This was created as a final project for the CSE 114 course during the Fall 2016 semester and remodeled with a graphical user-interface during the summer of 2017 with the intent of playing the game outside of a terminal console.
The game uses basic JavaFX software-making concepts such as object placements, scene creation, and event-handling.
